## Guess The Year - In Development
The Guess The Year app is designed for you to test your friends music, movie, game and event knowledge.

### Multiplayer
Choose a year, and submit. It's that simple!
The data will load, and you will be able to choose a song, movie, game or an event that occurred in that year. 
For further help and enjoyment, you can click the data to listen to the song, or learn more about the movie, or game.

### Single Player
For solo play, don't type a year and just hit submit. 
Be warned that clicking the links can sometimes spoil this experience.

## Upcoming Updates
* ~~Ability for single player mode to give up, or guess a year with feedback if they are correct or not.~~
* ~~Multiple shot mode (Allows multiple guesses without telling you the year).~~
* Feedback on how far away from the correct year your guess is - if feedback mode is enabled.
* Ability to choose a year range. e.g. Limiting the years to 1980-2021.
* Redesign the UI to use Material Design, and include media such as album art.

## Known Bugs
* The application can sometimes fail if the scraped data isn't returned correctly. [FIXED - Data is now local]
* Single Player mode has no option to submit a guessed year with feedback. [FIXED - User will be shown a win banner when correct]
* The event clues need to be randomised rather than start from the events of January, and end in at December. [POSSIBLY FIXED. Events appear to be random]
