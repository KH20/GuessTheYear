## Guess The Year - In Development
The Guess The Year app is designed for you to test your friends music, movie, game and event knowledge.

### Multiplayer
Choose a year, and submit. It's that simple!
The data will load, and you will be able to choose a song, movie, game or an event that occurred in that year. 
For further help and enjoyment, you can click the data to listen to the song, or learn more about the movie, or game.

### Single Player
For solo play, don't type a year and just hit submit. 
Be warned that clicking the clue links can sometimes spoil this experience by giving away the year (e.g. Movie clues link to IMDB, which displays the year of release).

## Upcoming Updates
* Feedback on how far away from the correct year your guess is - if feedback mode is enabled.
* Ability to choose a year range. e.g. Limiting the years to 1980-2021.
* Redesign the UI to use Material Design, and include media such as album art.
* A change for mobile platforms where the clues can be swiped across, and scrolling will only scroll the clue frame in focus.
* LONG TERM: User accounts and leaderboards for scores.

## Known Bugs
* Clues currently not clickable.
* Mobile View redesign needed.

Please let me know of any bugs!
